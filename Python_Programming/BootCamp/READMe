This BootCamp was taken for fun.




I will attempt to complete a Python BootCamp course in one weekend. I will work on the smaller assignments and upload them
either together or separate python files. 

I will also attempt and complete the capstone project that is required to complete the Bootcamp.


-------
The capstone project for being 35% done with the bootcamp is to build a simple
Tic Tac Toe game.
My approach:
    1) Build the game in incremental steps.
    2) I first made sure that the display_borad function would dispaly the board when
        passed a list of inputs.
    3) Then I asked users to input some imformation and returned player1 and player2 markers
    4) Then I asked users to update the marker position to add markers to the list passed to the
        display board.
    5) I then created a function that checked for any winners if there are no winners it is a cats game
