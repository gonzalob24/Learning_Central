# Python

This folder has problems from various books I have read. Like How to Think like a Computer Scientist and Data Structures and Algorithms.

I may not do all of the problems from each chapter since a lot of it is just for review.

## Arrays

    - copy.copy(A) vs copy.deepcopy(A): Use import copy
        - Relevant for compund objects
    - I can also use slicing to do a shallow copy
