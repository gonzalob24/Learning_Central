# Python

This folder has problems from various books I have read. Like How to Think like a Computer Scientist and Data Structures and Algorithms.

I may not do all of the problems from each chapter since a lot of it is just for review.

## Arrays

    - copy.copy(A) vs copy.deepcopy(A): Use import copy
        - Relevant for compund objects
    - I can also use slicing to copy arrays

## Trees

    - understand tree traversal using. Recursion makes it easier to travers trees.

## Recursion

    - List out different test cases

    - Find base case
    - Find recursive case

    - Time complexity:

    - Space complexity

    - Working with arrays or strings:

        - Create a helper function and maintain a reference to the index of the array. This avoids copying the array and reduces time complexity.

## Dynamic Prgramming

    - Try to viualize the problem in a tree structure.
    - Think about what goes inside each node
    - What are my branch factors. How do I get from one node to the next
    - The leafs will be my base cases.
