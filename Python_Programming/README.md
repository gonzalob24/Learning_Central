# Python

This folder has problems from various books I have read. Like How to Think like a Computer Scientist and Data Structures and Algorithms.

I may not do all of the problems from each chapter since a lot of it is just for review.

## Arrays

    - copy.copy(A) vs copy.deepcopy(A): Use import copy
        - Relevant for compund objects
    - I can also use slicing to copy arrays
    - think about storing elements in a stack or queue for temporary storage
    - Once I have a brute force solution. Look into time complexity and determine why it is slow. what is impacting its performance. Time/Space complexity.

## Trees

    - understand tree traversal: Inorder, Preorder, Postorder, Level Order
    - Recursion makes it easier to travers trees.
    - Try to use helper functions to make traversal easier
    -

## Recursion

    - List out different test cases

    - Find base case
    - Find recursive case

    - Time complexity:

    - Space complexity

    - Working with arrays or strings:

        - Create a helper function and maintain a reference to the index of the array. This avoids copying the array and reduces time complexity.

## Dynamic Prgramming

    - Try to viualize the problem in a tree structure.
    - Think about what goes inside each node
    - What are my branch factors. How do I get from one node to the next
    - The leafs will be my base cases.

## Collections

    - Math
    - max, sum can be used on array
    - name.count(char) --> counts cahracters in a string
    - collections.count(object) --> create dictionary very easily
