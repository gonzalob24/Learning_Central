      A SLR model that aims to train the correlation between the salary and the years of experience on the job.
      SLR used OLS method to plot the best fit line in between the dataset and tries to predict where the employees 
      salary should lie taking into consideration the experience.

      Continue removing the variables that are not statistically significant, one by one using Backward Elimination.

      SVR data results gave a better salary prediction for the employee

      DTR model results on position salaries. The DTR model is a non continuous model and gives a graph that looks like the 
      image above
      
   - [X] Random Forest Classification

      As I increased the size of the tree the salary of the employee converged to around 160k, the true value.
