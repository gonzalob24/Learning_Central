# Data Preprocessing

#### I created a template so that I can later use it with Simple, Multiple, Polyomial and Support Vector Regression. 
-----------------

Learned to import data sets and split the data into the dependent and independent variables and place them inside a matrix using pandas. 

I was then able to handle missing data by using the mean strategy to replace NaNâ€™s, 

Working with categorical data was simplified by encoding the data with values using OneHotEncoder.

I then split the data set into two sets, training set and test set.
