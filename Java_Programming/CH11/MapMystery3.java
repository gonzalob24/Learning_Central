 * Write the output that is printed when the given method below is passed each

 * map stores its key/value pairs in exactly the order shown, and that is the
 * order in which a for-each loop would examine them. Recall that maps print in
 * a {key1=value1, key2=value2, ..., keyN=valueN} format. Your answer should
 * display the right keys and values in the right order.
