/*
 * In this problem, the scenario we are evaluating is the following: You're
 * standing at the base of a staircase and are heading to the top. A small
 * stride will move up one stair, and a large stride advances two. You want to
 * count the number of ways to climb the entire staircase based on different
 * combinations of large and small strides. For example, a staircase of three
 * steps can be climbed in three different ways: three small strides, one small
 * stride followed by one large stride, or one large followed by one small.
 * 
 * Write a recursive method waysToClimb that takes a non-negative integer value
 * representing a number of stairs and prints each unique way to climb a
 * staircase of that height, taking strides of one or two stairs at a time. Your
 * method should output each way to climb the stairs on its own line, using a 1
 * to indicate a small stride of 1 stair, and a 2 to indicate a large stride of
 * 2 stairs. For example, the call of waysToClimb(3) should produce the
 * following output:
