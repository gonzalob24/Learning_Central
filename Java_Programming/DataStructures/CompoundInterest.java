 * PROGRAMMER: Gonzalo Betancourt
 * 
 * COURSE: CSCI 2315-02 Data Structures
 * 
 * DATE: September 11, 2019
 * 
 * ASSIGNMENT: Homework #1 Problem 2
 * 
 * ENVIRONMENT: Eclipse IDE, MacOS
 * 
 * FILES INCLUDED: Java Source code, Screen shot of working code, problem
 * solving document
 * 
 * PURPOSE: The program is to calculate the total investment and total earnings
 * when the interest rate and principal amount is given.
 * 
 * INPUT: interest rate in decimal 0.00 and principal amount in dollars.
 * 
 * PRECONDITIONS: Interest rate and principal must be positive values
 * 
 * OUTPUT: output will be yearly print statements that show the total investment
 * and total earnings
 * 
 * POSTCONDITIONS: The total earning will be more than the principal amount
 * after 40 years. At $500 per month investment with 6% rate and $2000 initial
 * investment the account should have at least 1 million.
 * 
 * ALGORITHM: Ask the user for interest rate and principal amount.
 * rate = a #
 * principal = a #
 * call compounding formula and print yearly results
 * Total = (Total + (Monthly * 12)) * (IntRate + 1)
 * 
 * ERRORS: If an error occurs the program will exit
 * 
 * EXAMPLE: Â 
 * Please enter an interest rate (0.00): 6
 * Please enter an initial investment: 2000
 * 
 * Year Total Invested Total Earned
 * 
 * 1 $8000.00 $8480.00
 * 2 $14480.00 $15348.80
 * 3 $21348.80 $22629.73
 * 4 $28629.73 $30347.51
