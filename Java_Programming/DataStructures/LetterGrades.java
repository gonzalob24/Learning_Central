/*
 * PROGRAMMER: Gonzalo Betancourt
 *
 * COURSE: CSCI 2315-02 Data Structures
 *
 * DATE: September 11, 2019
 *
 * ASSIGNMENT: Homework #1
 *
 * ENVIRONMENT: Mac OS, Windows or Linux
 *
 * FILES INCLUDED: Java Source code, Screen shot of working code, problem
 * solving document
 *
 * PURPOSE: A problem statement of what is done
 *
 * INPUT: Data used as input described here
 *
 * PRECONDITIONS: Assumptions for correct execution of this code
 *
 * OUTPUT: Output data is indicated
 *
 * POSTCONDITIONS: Only positive integers are input if user enter any number
 * less than 0 the program will quit
 *
 * ALGORITHM: How the program works. This should be structured using short,
 * descriptive phrases that are indented appropriately. At the beginning of the
 * program, you will have an overall algorithm to describe the flow of the
 * entire program. For each nontrivial module an algorithm will describe how
 * that module works or will make a very specific reference to an existing
 * algorithm (eg.QuickSort, BinarySearch), if a well-known algorithm is used.
 *
 *
 * ERRORS: What happens in case of unexpected input (optional)
 *
 * EXAMPLE: Please enter your grade using integers 1-100 (-1 to exit): 85 Your
 * 85.00 is equivalent to a B.
 *
 * Please enter your grade using integers 1-100 (-1 to exit): 32 Your 32.00 is
 * equivalent to an F.Â 
 *
 *
 * HISTORY: Useful if a sequence of assignments is based on the same project
 * (optional)
