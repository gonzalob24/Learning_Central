 * COURSE: CSCI 2315-02 Data Structures
 *
 * DATE: August 27, 2019 ASSIGNMENT:
 *
 * Homework #1 ENVIRONMENT: Mac OS, Windows or Linux
 *
 * FILES INCLUDED: List all filenames starting with main, and include header
 * files, input/output, executable, etc. when applicable PURPOSE: A problem
 * statement of what is done INPUT: Data used as input described here
 *
 * PRECONDITIONS: Assumptions for correct execution of this code OUTPUT: Output
 * data is indicated
 *
 * POSTCONDITIONS: Assertions that describe the results of actions taken by code
 *
 * ALGORITHM: How the program works. This should be structured using short,
 * descriptive phrases that are indented appropriately. At the beginning of the
 * program, you will have an overall algorithm to describe the flow of the

 * that module works or will make a very specific reference to an existing
 * algorithm (eg.QuickSort, BinarySearch), if a well-known algorithm is used.
 *
 *
 * ERRORS: What happens in case of unexpected input (optional)
