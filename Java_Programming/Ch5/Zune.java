//The following code is a slightly modified version of actual code that was in the Microsoft Zune music 
//player in 2008. The code attempts to calculate today's date by determining how many years and days have 
//passed since 1980. Assume the existence of methods for getting the total number of days since 1980 and for 
//determining whether a given year is a leap year.

//Thousands of Zune players locked up at the very end of 2008, which was a leap year. (Microsoft quickly 
//released a patch to fix the problem.) What is the problem with the preceding code, and in what cases will it 
//exhibit incorrect behavior? Fix the code to always return the correct date.
